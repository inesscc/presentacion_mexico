# Context


--

- What is a **sampling frame**?

    - It is a list where it is possible to identify all the units
    - We will work with the dwellings sampling frame

--

- How often is the sampling Frame updated?

    - After each Population and Housing Census (~10 years)
    - Stratification takes about 2 more years

--
  
- What is stratification and what is it for?

    - It is the clustering of the PSU according to homogeneous socioeconomic groups
    - In sociology and economics it is a proxy for material well-being
    - Increases the efficiency of survey samples (lower cost)
    - Improves the accuracy of estimates from surveys
    - Improves the targeting of public policy

# Context

--

- How is the sampling frame updated?

    - With information from the Pre-census (Urban Limits, structure)
    - With information from the Census questionnaire (for stratification)

# Problem and aims

--

- This work seeks to stratify the sampling frame at the PSU level

--

- What is the problem currently?

    - The Censuses do not ask for income due to its difficulty of capture
    - It has been stratified with variables that are considered a *proxy* of well-being
        - Percentage of people in higher education at the PSU
        - Occupancy rate at the PSU
        -	Percentage of homes with a high materiality index in the PSU
        -	Total children born

--

- in summary:

    - The methodology is **slow to update**
    - The variables available for the procedure are **inadequate**
    - The methodology is questioned: **non-structural variables**

# Problem and aims

--

- .medium-par[General aim:]

--

**Stratify** selected portions of the dwelling sampling frame in the **Metropolitan Region**, distinguishing PSU of **high, medium and low** stratum, from satellite images using **visual recognition with deep learning**.

--

- .medium-par[Specific aims:]

1. **Automate** a process of **capture and storage** of satellite images.
2. Carry out training based on PSU for which information on **household income** (*ground truth*) is available.
3. **Evaluate the quality of the classification** through evaluation metrics and contrasting with external information and against expert judgment.
4. Generate a proposal to **put into production** the model for the rest of the country's regions.

# Inicial solution and progress status

--

1. Obtaining data from surveys that capture income with their identified PSUs ✔️

--

2. Obtaining polygons associated with UPM achieved ✔️

--

3. PSU cut through *software* SAS Planet ✔️

--

4. PSU labelling &#9997;

--

5. Development of a binary classifier prototype (low stratum / other) ✔️

--

6. Development of multiclass classifier (high, medium, low) &#10060;

--

7. Classification evaluation &#9997;

--

8. Validation with expert judgment &#10060;

--

9. Final adjustments to the model and/or training data &#10060;

--

10. Proposal for production &#10060;

--

11. Writing of the methodological document &#9997;

# Data characteristics

- The training set is made up of satellite image clippings that each represent a PSU.

--

- Information for labeling is available from 3 surveys.

--

- Total of **1843 images** for training.

--

- Some example images:

--

low stratum PSU:

# Main challenges

--

- Automate polygon clipping.

--

- We are currently training with 211 images (~15% low stratum). It remains to label the rest of the images with survey information.

--

- The **labelling is not trivial**. It implies a deep knowledge of income measurement in surveys.

--

- Currently the classifier obtains an 85% accuracy, **predicting the absence of the attribute in all cases**.

--

- An alternative to exploring is to **add known external information** to the images, such as the district.

--

- **The amount of data available is limited**, unless another approach is taken, such as predicting the stratum of each building within a PSU.

    - how to detect each building with its bounding box?

--

- The images are **complex** and very **various**.

# Main challenges

# Next steps

--

- **Finish labeling** of the UPM that we are not using in training yet

--

- Try different **image preprocessing** strategies.

--

- Try different network architectures (I've only tried Densenet and Mobilenet so far)

--

- Try **fine tuning** and **data augmentation** strategies, to overcome the problem of scarce data.

--

- Test strategy to predict the stratum of each building within a PSU.
